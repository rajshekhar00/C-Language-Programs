119: The Power of Recursion

Hello, Code Enthusiasts! 👩‍💻👨‍💻

Let's unravel the mystical realm of recursion today! 🌀✨

🔄 What is Recursion?
Recursion is a programming concept where a function calls itself in its own definition. It's a powerful technique that can simplify complex problems.

🌐 Fibonacci Sequence using Recursion in C:

#include <stdio.h>

int fibonacci(int n) {
    if (n <= 1)
        return n;
    return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2);
}

int main() {
    int n = 5;
    printf("Fibonacci sequence up to %d terms:\n", n);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        printf("%d ", fibonacci(i));
    }
    return 0;
}


🤔 Why Recursion?
1. Elegant Solutions: Certain problems are naturally expressed using recursion, making the code more elegant.
2. Divide and Conquer: Recursive solutions often follow a divide-and-conquer approach, breaking down problems into smaller, more manageable subproblems.
