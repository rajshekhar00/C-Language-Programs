118: The Art of Debugging

Hello, Tech Enthusiasts! 👩‍💻👨‍💻

Let's dive into the art of debugging – a skill every coder should master! 🛠️✨

🕵️ What is Debugging?
Debugging is like solving a puzzle. It's the process of identifying and fixing issues in your code. Here are some tips to level up your debugging game:

1. Print Statements are Your Friends:
   - Strategically place print statements to trace the flow of your code.
   - Outputting variable values helps understand their states.

2. Rubber Duck Debugging:
   - Explain your code problem to an inanimate object or a rubber duck.
   - This technique often leads to self-realization of the issue.

3. Use Debugging Tools:
   - Familiarize yourself with IDE debuggers and tools like gdb for C.
   - Set breakpoints and step through your code to catch bugs in action.

4. Binary Search for Bugs:
   - Divide and conquer – narrow down the section where the bug exists.
   - Isolate the problem area before delving into the details.

🚀 Level Up:
Embrace debugging as a crucial part of your coding journey. It's not just about fixing errors; it's about understanding your code deeply.
